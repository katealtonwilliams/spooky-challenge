# Time for a spooky brainteaser!

Iâ€™ve been helping Max out this week with a Halloween themed brainteaser!

You have been given a jumbled message and your job is to decipher the code and reveal a spooky image.

The code will consist of several lines of a secret code. You will need to find the 
first and last single digit in each line, to form a 2 digit number. For example: 
lPn1hg5p becomes 1 5 = 15
kl0hnb7x become 0 7 = 7
These numbers form co-ordinates, with each two lines providing the row and column number for each point. So, the above lines would be pointing to the point at row 15 and column 7. You must plot these points to reveal an image.
For example, the below message:
Forms the horizontal line:
To make things more interesting, digits can also be represented using spooky words, with each word being equal to the digits as show below:
Therefore the line:
lurkingThoPl9x = 59
With this rule, the below input:
forms the spooky inverted cross:
Finally, the code can contain any digit, letter, or special character. So the below code:
Gives us a witches hat:
Once you have cracked all of these examples, send me a message and I will send you a unique input that will reveal the spookiest image of all!
